# Remove the bundled upstream aioslimproto. The patched provider imports
# aioslimproto.sync, which does not exist upstream; that import fails on the
# first load, which makes Music Assistant install *all* of the provider's
# requirements - including the git+ fork pinned in the manifest. If the bundled
# copy stayed installed, its `const` submodule would already be cached and the
# retry after the install would not pick up the patched constants.

# Left empty, Music Assistant installs the version pinned in the provider manifest
# on the first provider load (see README). Set it to try an aioslimproto revision
# that the manifest of the pinned server revision does not point to yet: the
# provider then imports cleanly on its first load, and Music Assistant, which only
# (re)installs the manifest requirement when that import fails, leaves it alone.
